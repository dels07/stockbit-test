# Stockbit Backend Engineer Test

## Test #1

The test is in folder **test 1**, I included both DDL & DML that can be run using MySQL.

Also I add a dbfiddle for this: https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/uLqo9jJSv2uRdT3nJYXWow/0

## Test #3

Test test is in folder **test 3**, I made simple assertions before doing refactor to ensure function currently match expectations.

You can check the assertions from line **21 - 31**, to run this you can use jsfiddle/jsbin, browser console or if you have node already setup type this in your terminal:

```bash
node "./test 3/index.js"
```
